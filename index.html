      <p class="white_txt">Jumping spiders are a group of spiders that constitute the family Salticidae. As of 2019, this family contained
        over 600 described genera and over 6,000 described species,[1] making it the largest family of spiders at 13% of
        all species.[2] Jumping spiders have some of the best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting,
        and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very
        agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their
        book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping
        spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes, with the
        anterior median pair being particularly large.</p>

      <p class="white_txt">Cattle (Bos taurus) are large, domesticated, cloven-hooved, herbivores. They are a prominent modern member of
        the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. Adult females are referred to as cows
        and adult males are referred to as bulls.

        Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle),
        and for hides, which are used to make leather. They are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or
        bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements). Another product of cattle is their dung, which can be
        used to create manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious
        significance. Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu, are also kept as pets.</p>

      <h2>Cats</h2>

      <p class="white_txt">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated
        species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it
        from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral
        cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for
        companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
        registries.[6]

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp
        teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
        developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
        grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter.
        As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
        frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives
        pheromones.</p>
